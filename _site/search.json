I will evaluate you based on this engagement, which means that technically correct but low effort answers which do not demonstrate engagement or understanding will receive no credit.\nWhen you answer questions in this class, your goal is to show that you either understand the material or are actively engaging with it. If you did not achieve this goal, then your answer is incomplete, regardless of whether or not it is technically correct. This is not to encourage you to add unnecessary complexity to your answer - simple, elegant solutions are always preferable to unwieldly, complex solutions that accomplish the same task.\nWhile this is not an English class, grammar and spelling are important, as is your ability to communicate technical information in writing; both of these criteria will be used in addition to assignment-specific rubrics to evaluate your work."

    "text": "Assignment Breakdown\n\nA. Weekly Reflection Journal\nObjective: This journal is designed to enhance your learning experience in statistical computing. By actively documenting your progress, reflecting on challenges, and acknowledging your achievements, you will deepen your understanding and improve your problem-solving skills in R programming.\nComponents of the Journal:\n\nQuarto File – ‘The Journal’:\n\nEach week, you will maintain a digital journal in a Quarto file. This journal is your space to document new R functions you’ve learned, errors encountered, and reflections on your learning journey.\nWeekly Entries:\n\nFunction Log: Note any new R functions you learn each week, detailing their purpose and an example of their usage.\nError Diary: Record any significant errors you encounter, describe the issue, and explain how you resolved it. This diary will serve as a valuable resource for troubleshooting. Throughout the course, students are likely to encounter various errors, both minor and significant. Initially, log all errors, including omitted arguments, to build a strong foundation; as proficiency increases, focus on documenting more complex and conceptually challenging errors.\nReflection: Pen a brief reflection on your learning experiences, the challenges you faced, and how you plan to apply or improve upon this knowledge in the future.\n\n\nWeekly Quiz:\n\nTo complement your journaling and ensure consistent engagement, a brief, three-question quiz will be administered each week. This quiz reflects on the information entered into your journal.\nQuiz Format:\n\nOne question about a newly learned R function.\nOne question about a noteworthy error you encountered and resolved.\nOne question about a significant aspect of your learning journey.\n\nPurpose: The quiz is not graded for correctness but serves as a mechanism of accountability. It encourages you to thoroughly engage with your journal entries and reflect on your weekly learning experiences.\nSubmission and Grading: Quizzes will be submitted via Canvas and are due every Sunday at 11:59 pm. They are graded based on completion, emphasizing the importance of regular reflection and participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Journal\n\n\n\n\nAn example Quarto Journal will be provided on Canvas. Your journal will not be graded but your quizzes\n\n\n\n\nAll responses to Check-ins are due Sundays at 11:59 pm.\n\n\n\nB. Check-ins\nEach week, you will find short Check-In questions or tasks throughout the text to make sure you are prepared for class that week. Make sure you submit your answers to these on Canvas to get credit for your efforts. Note that the Canvas Check-in quizzes can be submitted up to three times without a penalty - so you should get 100% on this part of the course!\n\nAll responses to Check-ins are due Tuesdays at 8:00am.\n\n\n\nC. Practice Activities\nMost Tuesday’s, you will be given a Practice Activity to complete, to get the hang of the week’s necessary R skills. These activities will always result in a single, straightforward correct answer, that you will submit via Canvas (one attempt). Therefore, there is no reason you should not get full credit in this category!\nSince these activities are intended to be your first attempt at new skills, they are meant to be done with help from me and your peers. Therefore, you will always be given some time in class to work on them.\n\nPractice Activities are due Thursdays at 8:00am.\n\n\n\nD. The Midterms\nThis course includes two midterms, both of which are cumulative in nature. The purpose of these exams is to assess your understanding of the material covered and your ability to apply R programming skills in various contexts. The first midterm is scheduled for February 1, 2024, and will cover the initial chapters of the course. The second midterm is on February 29, 2024, and will include all content up to that date. These midterms are designed not just to test your knowledge, but also to strengthen your ability to think critically and process code effectively under different circumstances.\n\nMidterm 1 is on Thursday 2/1/2024 at 4:10pm\nMidterm 2 is on Thursday 2/29/2024 at 4:10pm.\n\n\n\nE. Lab Assignments\nYour typical homework assignments will be weekly labs. You will follow each lab’s instructions to complete tasks in R and submit a rendered .html Quarto document to Canvas.\nMost weeks, there will be class time on Thursdays dedicated to working on completing lab assignments.\n\nLabs are due on Mondays at 11:59pm.\n\n\n\nF. The Final Project\nThe capstone of our course is a final project where you will develop an R Shiny application, choosing from one of the following thematic areas: Spotify, Sports, Census Data, or Finance Data. This project is a culmination of all the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course, presented through a practical lens. Each chapter of the textbook contributes to the skills and knowledge you will apply in this project, making it an integrative and hands-on experience. The aim is not only to solidify your understanding of R but also to showcase your ability to create a real-world application that leverages the powerful features of R Shiny.\n\n\nG. The Final Exam\nThe final exam, scheduled for March 21, 2024 in this room, will be comprehensive, encompassing all the topics we have covered throughout the course. While the exam is cumulative, it is not weighted as heavily as the final project. This structure is intentional, as the course places a greater emphasis on the practical application of skills and knowledge through the final project. The final exam serves as an opportunity to reinforce and demonstrate your overall understanding of statistical computing with R.\n\nThe final is on Thursday 3/21/2024 at 7:10pm - 10:00pm"
