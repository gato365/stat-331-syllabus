\hypertarget{general-evaluation-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{General Evaluation
Criteria}\label{general-evaluation-criteria}}

In every assignment, discussion, and written component of this class,
you are expected to demonstrate that you are intellectually engaging
with the material. I will evaluate you based on this engagement, which
means that technically correct but low effort answers which do not
demonstrate engagement or understanding will receive no credit.

When you answer questions in this class, your goal is to show that you
either understand the material or are actively engaging with it. If you
did not achieve this goal, then your answer is incomplete, regardless of
whether or not it is technically correct. This is not to encourage you
to add unnecessary complexity to your answer - simple, elegant solutions
are always preferable to unwieldly, complex solutions that accomplish
the same task.

While this is not an English class, grammar and spelling are important,
as is your ability to communicate technical information in writing; both
of these criteria will be used in addition to assignment-specific
rubrics to evaluate your work.

\hypertarget{a.-weekly-reflection-journal}{%
\subsubsection{A. Weekly Reflection
Journal}\label{a.-weekly-reflection-journal}}

\textbf{Objective}: This journal is designed to enhance your learning
experience in statistical computing. By actively documenting your
progress, reflecting on challenges, and acknowledging your achievements,
you will deepen your understanding and improve your problem-solving
skills in R programming.

\textbf{Components of the Journal}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Quarto File -- `The Journal'}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Each week, you will maintain a digital journal in a Quarto file.
    This journal is your space to document new R functions you've
    learned, errors encountered, and reflections on your learning
    journey.
  \item
    \textbf{Weekly Entries}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \textbf{Function Log}: Note any new R functions you learn each
      week, detailing their purpose and an example of their usage.
    \item
      \textbf{Error Diary}: Record any significant errors you encounter,
      describe the issue, and explain how you resolved it. This diary
      will serve as a valuable resource for troubleshooting. Throughout
      the course, students are likely to encounter various errors, both
      minor and significant. Initially, log all errors, including
      omitted arguments, to build a strong foundation; as proficiency
      increases, focus on documenting more complex and conceptually
      challenging errors.
    \item
      \textbf{Reflection}: Pen a brief reflection on your learning
      experiences, the challenges you faced, and how you plan to apply
      or improve upon this knowledge in the future.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Weekly Quiz}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To complement your journaling and ensure consistent engagement, a
    brief, three-question quiz will be administered each week. This quiz
    reflects on the information entered into your journal.
  \item
    \textbf{Quiz Format}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      One question about a newly learned R function.
    \item
      One question about a noteworthy error you encountered and
      resolved.
    \item
      One question about a significant aspect of your learning journey.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Purpose}: The quiz is not graded for correctness but serves
    as a mechanism of accountability. It encourages you to thoroughly
    engage with your journal entries and reflect on your weekly learning
    experiences.
  \item
    \textbf{Submission and Grading}: Quizzes will be submitted via
    Canvas and are due every Sunday at 11:59 pm. They are graded based
    on completion, emphasizing the importance of regular reflection and
    participation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{b.-check-ins}{%
\subsubsection{B. Check-ins}\label{b.-check-ins}}

Each week, you will find short Check-In questions or tasks throughout
the text to make sure you are prepared for class that week. Make sure
you submit your answers to these on Canvas to get credit for your
efforts. Note that the Canvas Check-in quizzes can be submitted up to
three times without a penalty - so you should get 100\% on this part of
the course!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All responses to Check-ins are due \textbf{Tuesdays at 8:00am}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{c.-practice-activities}{%
\subsubsection{C. Practice Activities}\label{c.-practice-activities}}

Most Tuesday's, you will be given a Practice Activity to complete, to
get the hang of the week's necessary \texttt{R} skills. These activities
will always result in a single, straightforward correct answer, that you
will submit via Canvas (one attempt). Therefore, there is no reason you
should not get full credit in this category!

Since these activities are intended to be your first attempt at new
skills, they are meant to be done with help from me and your peers.
Therefore, you will always be given some time in class to work on them.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Practice Activities are due \textbf{Thursdays at 8:00am.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{d.-the-midterms}{%
\subsubsection{D. The Midterms}\label{d.-the-midterms}}

This course includes two midterms, both of which are cumulative in
nature. The purpose of these exams is to assess your understanding of
the material covered and your ability to apply R programming skills in
various contexts. The first midterm is scheduled for February 1, 2024,
and will cover the initial chapters of the course. The second midterm is
on February 29, 2024, and will include all content up to that date.
These midterms are designed not just to test your knowledge, but also to
strengthen your ability to think critically and process code effectively
under different circumstances.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Midterm 1 is on \textbf{Thursday 2/1/2024 at 4:10pm}
\item
  Midterm 2 is on \textbf{Thursday 2/29/2024 at 4:10pm}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{e.-lab-assignments}{%
\subsubsection{E. Lab Assignments}\label{e.-lab-assignments}}

Your typical homework assignments will be weekly labs. You will follow
each lab's instructions to complete tasks in \texttt{R} and submit a
rendered .html Quarto document to Canvas.

Most weeks, there will be class time on Thursdays dedicated to working
on completing lab assignments.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Labs are due on \textbf{Mondays at 11:59pm}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{f.-the-final-project}{%
\subsubsection{F. The Final Project}\label{f.-the-final-project}}

The capstone of our course is a final project where you will develop an
R Shiny application, choosing from one of the following thematic areas:
Spotify, Sports, Census Data, or Finance Data. This project is a
culmination of all the concepts and techniques learned throughout the
course, presented through a practical lens. Each chapter of the textbook
contributes to the skills and knowledge you will apply in this project,
making it an integrative and hands-on experience. The aim is not only to
solidify your understanding of R but also to showcase your ability to
create a real-world application that leverages the powerful features of
R Shiny.

\hypertarget{g.-the-final-exam}{%
\subsubsection{G. The Final Exam}\label{g.-the-final-exam}}

The final exam, scheduled for March 21, 2024 in this room, will be
comprehensive, encompassing all the topics we have covered throughout
the course. While the exam is cumulative, it is not weighted as heavily
as the final project. This structure is intentional, as the course
places a greater emphasis on the practical application of skills and
knowledge through the final project. The final exam serves as an
opportunity to reinforce and demonstrate your overall understanding of
statistical computing with R.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The final is on \textbf{Thursday 3/21/2024 at 7:10pm - 10:00pm}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{attendance-participation}{%
\subsection{Attendance \&
Participation}\label{attendance-participation}}

I do not take formal attendance in this class. However, it is my
expectation that you remain in class and on task until you have finished
all your activities and assignments. Consistent, repeated failure to
attend class or actively participate in portions of the course will
affect the demonstration of your engagement with the course.

\subsection{Extra Credit Opportunity}\label{extra-credit-opportunity}}

\textbf{If you see me on campus, you know me.} Ask me a statistical
question. You will fill out this
\href{https://forms.gle/xf2oSkBiZDsBNJmu7}{survey} an I will give points
to you at the end of quarter.

I currently do not know how many points.

You will get out of this course what you put in. The following excerpt
was taken from Rob Jenkins' article ``Defining the Relationship'' which
was published in The Chronicle of Higher Education (August 8, 2016).
This accurately summarizes what I expect of you in my classroom (and
also what you should expect of me).

\emph{``I'd like to be your partner. More than anything, I'd like for us
to form a mutually beneficial alliance in this endeavor we call
education.}

\emph{I pledge to do my part. I will:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Stay abreast of the latest ideas in my field.}
\item
  \emph{Teach you what I believe you need to know; with all the
  enthusiasm I possess.}
\item
  \emph{Invite your comments and questions and respond constructively.}
\item
  \emph{Make myself available to you outside of class (within reason).}
\item
  \emph{Evaluate your work carefully and return it promptly with
  feedback.}
\item
  \emph{Be as fair, respectful, and understanding as I can humanly be.}
\item
  \emph{If you need help beyond the scope of this course, I will do my
  best to provide it or see that you get it.}
\end{itemize}

\emph{In return, I expect you to:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Show up for class each day or let me know (preferably in
  advance) if you have some good reason to be absent.}
\item
  \emph{Do your reading and other assignments outside of class and be
  prepared for each class meeting.}
\item
  \emph{Focus during class on the work we're doing and not on extraneous
  matters (like whoever or whatever is on your phone at the moment).}
\item
  \emph{Participate in class discussions.}
\item
  \emph{Be respectful of your fellow students and their points of view.}
\item
  \emph{In short, I expect you to devote as much effort to learning as I
  devote to teaching.}
\end{itemize}

\emph{What you get out of this relationship is that you'll be better
equipped to succeed in this and other college courses, work-related
assignments, and life in general. What I get is a great deal of
professional and personal satisfaction. Because I do really like you
{[}all{]} and want the best for you.''}

\hypertarget{make-mistakes}{%
\subsubsection{Make Mistakes!}\label{make-mistakes}}

Programming is the process of making a series of silly or stupid
mistakes, and then slowly fixing each mistake (while adding a few more).
The only way to know how to fix these mistakes (and avoid them in the
future) is to make them. (Sometimes, you have to make the same mistake a
few dozen times before you can avoid it in the future). At some point
during the class, you will find that you've spent 30 minutes staring at
an error caused by a typo, a space, a parenthesis in the wrong place.
You may ask for help debugging this weird error, only to have someone
immediately point out the problem\ldots{} it is always easier to see
these things in someone else's code. This is part of programming, it is
normal, and you shouldn't feel embarrassed or sorry (unless you put no
effort into troubleshooting the problem before you asked for help)

If you manage to produce an error I haven't seen before, then
congratulations. You have achieved something special, and that
achievement should be celebrated. Each new and bizarre error is an
opportunity to learn a bit more about the programming language, the
operating system, or the interaction between the two.

\hypertarget{learning-environment-and-support}{%
\section{Learning Environment and
Support}\label{learning-environment-and-support}}

I am committed to creating a safe and inclusive learning environment
where all students feel respected and supported. If there are any ways I
can improve the classroom environment to make it more welcoming for you,
please don't hesitate to let me know.

If you have a disability and require accommodations to fully participate
in the course, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss how I
can best support you. I also encourage you to register with Cal Poly's
Disability Resource Center (Building 124, Room 119 or at 805-756-1395)
to explore additional accommodations that may be available to you.

If you are experiencing food insecurity, housing instability, or other
challenges that may impact your ability to succeed in this course,
please refer to the resources listed on Canvas under ``Student Support
Services at Cal Poly.'' These resources provide a range of essential
support services, including emergency financial assistance, counseling,
and academic support.

I am committed to working with you to ensure that you have the resources
and support you need to succeed in this course. Let's work together to
create a positive and inclusive learning environment for all students.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity-and-class-conduct}{%
\section{Academic Integrity and Class
Conduct}\label{academic-integrity-and-class-conduct}}

Academic integrity is a fundamental value of this course and of the
university. Simply put, I will not tolerate cheating, plagiarism, or any
other form of academic dishonesty.

Any incident of academic misconduct, including dishonesty, copying, or
plagiarism, will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.

Cheating will earn you a grade of 0\% on the assignment and an overall
grade penalty of at least 10\%. In circumstances of flagrant cheating,
you may be given a grade of F in the course.

It is important to note that paraphrasing or quoting another's work
without proper citation is a form of academic misconduct. This includes
the \texttt{R} code produced by someone else! Writing code is like
writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from
someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is
different.

Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's
work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly
acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. This includes using Chat GPT,
which should only be used to help you problem solve just as a tutor or
peer would, and not as a substitute for your own work. If you are
struggling with writing the \texttt{R} code for an assignment, please
reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you rather than you
spending hours Googling things and get nowhere!

If you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are
expected to ask for clarification.

To ensure academic integrity, please be sure to cite all sources
appropriately and only use Chat GPT in an ethical manner. For more
information on academic misconduct and what constitutes cheating and
plagiarism, please see
\href{https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating}{academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating}.

The California Faculty Association (the labor union of Lecturers,
Professors, Coaches, Counselors, and Librarians across the 23 CSU
campuses) is in a difficult contract dispute with California State
University management. It is possible that we will call a strike or
other work stoppage this term. I promise to promptly inform you of any
schedule disruption. Our working conditions are your learning
conditions; we seek to protect both. For further information go to
