    "text": "Assignment Breakdown\n\nTuesday Quizzes\n\nPurpose: These quizzes assess your understanding of material introduced in pre-class videos and covered during the previous week’s classes. They are designed to ensure that you’ve grasped foundational concepts and are prepared for deeper application in subsequent tasks.\nFormat: Each quiz consists of 3 short questions that focus on recall and basic application of concepts. You will have a single attempt, and these quizzes are open-note, emphasizing the importance of preparation and active engagement with class materials.\nWhat to Expect: Questions may include definitions, identification of key functions, or simple applications to reinforce your learning. Do not use any AI software or any resources outside of the notes for these quizzes.\nStudents will have 1 attempt to complete the quiz. You will not be given time to complete the quiz in class.\nOpens on Every Tuesday at 8:00am and closes on Wednesday at 11:59pm.\n\n\n\n\nHomework Assignments\n\nPurpose: Homework provides structured practice with key functions and concepts discussed in class, often through the lens of the ETV (Extraction, Transformation, Visualization) framework. Assignments also introduce new tasks or functions not covered in class, with clear instructions on their use, encouraging independent learning and exploration.\nFormat: Each assignment includes a series of coding exercises and applied tasks. These may involve completing an ETV cycle, solving real-world data problems, or using specific functions to manipulate and visualize data. There will 12 questions per homework assignment.\nWhat to Expect: Homework emphasizes problem-solving and creativity, often requiring you to integrate multiple concepts into a cohesive workflow. Use AI and other resources to help you problem solve, but do not use them to complete the homework.\nStudents will have 5 attempts to complete the homework.\nOpens on Thursday at 8:00am and closes on the following Wednesday at 11:59pm.\n\n\n\n\nFriday Quizzes\n\nPurpose: These quizzes focus on evaluating your ability to apply the concepts, functions, and techniques covered during the week’s classes. They are an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the material in a practical context.\nFormat: Each quiz includes 10 questions, blending conceptual understanding with applied problem-solving. Unlike Tuesday quizzes, these are more comprehensive and designed to integrate ideas from the week’s tasks.\nWhat to Expect: Questions may involve interpreting code, applying multiple steps of the ETV framework, or solving problems based on class discussions and tasks. Do not use any AI software or any resources outside of the notes for these quizzes.\nStudents will have 1 attempt to complete the quiz. You will not be given time to complete the quiz in class.\nOpens on Every Friday at 8:00am (the days you do not have a midterm) and closes on Saturday at 11:59pm.\n\n\n\n\nMidterm Exams\n\nPurpose: Midterms assess your comprehensive understanding of the material covered up to the exam date. They test your ability to demonstrate mastery through problem-solving, practical application, and reflection on how tasks connect to broader data analysis principles.\nFormat: Exams may include multiple-choice questions, coding-based tasks, and short-answer explanations. You will be asked to apply the ETV framework and other concepts to solve structured problems and demonstrate critical thinking. There will be 8 questions per midterm.\nWhat to Expect: Midterms challenge you to show how well you can perform tasks learned in class and connect them to previous concepts.\nStudents will have 1 attempt to complete the midterm. You will complete midterms in class.\nThursdays Week 3, 6 and 9. These exams can between 50-75 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Exam\n\nPurpose: The final exam evaluates your cumulative understanding of the entire course. It ensures you can integrate and apply the concepts, techniques, and tools learned over the quarter in a coherent and meaningful way.\nFormat: The exam will consist of a mix of conceptual questions, coding tasks, and applied scenarios requiring a complete ETV workflow. You may also be asked to reflect on how your problem-solving skills have developed throughout the course. There will be 26 questions on the final exam.\nWhat to Expect: Expect questions that ask you to apply all stages of ETV to complex, real-world datasets, along with explanations of your approach and decision-making process.\nThursday, March 20.\n\n\nJust because I like numbers, I just want to let you know there will be 270 questions in total for the quarter."

The goal of ETV is to simulate real-world data workflows, enabling students to handle data from acquisition to actionable insights effectively.\n\nExtraction: Students must demonstrate their ability to acquire data from diverse sources. This step involves understanding the structure of raw data and preparing it for further processing, mirroring real-world challenges in data integration.\nTransformation: Beyond technical correctness, students are expected to actively engage with tasks such as cleaning, filtering, reshaping, and normalizing data. Intellectual engagement is demonstrated through the clarity and rationale behind their transformations, reflecting a deep understanding of the material.\nVisualization: Students will learn to create meaningful visual representations of data to communicate insights effectively. This step emphasizes not only technical proficiency but also the ability to think critically about how best to present information.\n\nIn every task, engagement with the material is paramount. This means that technically correct but low-effort answers that do not demonstrate understanding or effort will not receive full credit. Similarly, while simplicity is valued, it must not come at the expense of depth or accuracy."
